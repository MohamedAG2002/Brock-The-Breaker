# BrockTheBreaker
How many Breakout clones are there? Don't count! Just add one more to the stash.

Brock The Breaker is just another Breakout clone with a few sprites and audio samples that were made by me.
It is nothing special, just a Breakout clone made with SFML and C++, as many other Breakout clones have.

Clone the repo if you want to tinker with it, or visit my itch.io page if you want to try it out for what ever reason.

Either way, enjoy!
